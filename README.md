# Experiments with C++

Simple code with c++ testing the very basic resources of the language.

The codes in this repository are compatible with C ++ and were all made using Visual Studio (VS) Community Edition (it is free :-).
Basically the code is in the .cpp and .h files inside the directories. However VS creates a lot of other files to configure what it calls a project or solution. This makes it easier for VS to know which files make up your program.

> If you are using VS, just use the open project option in the menu to open the code in each folder. Why I'm using VS? Because it is the IDE that I have less experience, so I'm killing two birds with one stone.

> If your are using other platform, you will have some trouble to migrate the .cpp/.h file to the other platform's structure.


## Recommended videos

If you want to learn C++ there are many good videos in YouTube.
Some of my favorites are:

* [C++ Tutorial 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y0bp-mnYU0)
* [C++ Programming All-in-One Tutorial Series (10 HOURS!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bYFu9mBnr4)


# How to learn !

In order for you to enjoy the courses contained in the videos listed above (or any other that you find on the internet) I strongly recommend that you accompany them by implementing the code.

So first you need to install and configure your development IDE (I list below some IDEs). To follow the courses, the most basic IDEs (such as CodeBlocks) are sufficient, however I suggest that you try professional platforms, as learning how to use them is important for your professional life.

Now on how to follow the courses?
Watch each segment of the video, pause and return so that you can reproduce all the code shown by the teacher.
In this part you can simply copy what is being shown and then execute the code.
Run the code and try to understand what it is doing! __THAT'S IMPORTANT!__

Experiment with other inputs. For example, suppose that the video shows how to request the entry of 2 numbers and then the code add them up. The teacher shows the input with two integers.
What happens if you type one of them as a real number (float), or type an invalid number (for example with a letter in the middle of typing)?

This type of experiment allows you to better understand how the program works.
If you already have a little more experience, try to see if you can solve the problem within the code to deal with a wrong entry.
For example, you want to add two integers, so the entry __ has__ must be an integer.
To solve the problem, you can then try to prevent the user from typing anything other than a valid number, or you can detect a wrong entry and request it again before making the sum, or any other solution.
This helps your development, because now you are trying to figure out new code.
